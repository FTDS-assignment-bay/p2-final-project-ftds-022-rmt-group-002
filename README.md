## Introduction
Introducing **"Gold Seeker"** - Your ultimate companion for making informed gold purchasing decisions! Using historical gold price data, our machine learning recommendation system predicts the lowest gold prices for the next 3 months and recommends three e-commerce stores offering gold at prices that are close to the predicted values. Don't miss out on the best gold deals; let Gold Seeker be your guide to finding affordable gold.

## Problem Background
Investing in gold has become one of the popular and considered safe investment options in recent years. However, the decision to buy gold is often based on its volatile prices, and investors often struggle to determine when and where they should buy gold. Fluctuating gold prices can leave consumers confused and unsure about when to make gold purchases, potentially resulting in missed profit opportunities or suboptimal purchases.
## Objectives
1. **Gold Price Prediction:** The primary goal of our application is to utilize machine learning to predict the lowest gold prices for the next 3 months. This will provide valuable information to gold investors and buyers, enabling them to make smarter and timely decisions on when to purchase gold.

2. **Gold Store Recommendations:** In addition to predicting gold prices, our application will recommend three e-commerce stores selling gold at prices close to the predicted values. This will assist our users in finding the best gold sellers with competitive prices.

3. **Time and Money Savings:** With accurate information and gold store recommendations, our application aims to help users save time and money while providing them with confidence in their gold purchase decisions.

4. **Gold Investment Education:** Furthermore, we also aim to provide additional education to users about gold investment, allowing them to better understand the world of gold investment and how to leverage it effectively.

With this application, we hope to provide a comprehensive solution for those interested in investing in or buying gold by delivering reliable price predictions and recommendations for the best stores.

## Further Recommendations
1. **Advanced Scheduling Utilization:** In addition to predicting gold prices and recommending products, consider integrating advanced scheduling. This would allow users to set up notifications or alerts when gold prices reach levels they are interested in or when the recommended e-commerce stores have special offers. This will enhance user engagement and provide them with more control over their investment decisions.

2. **Utilization of Advanced Modeling:** Consider developing advanced models such as Deep Learning or Time Series Forecasting to improve the accuracy of gold price predictions. These advanced models can provide more sophisticated and detailed results, which can boost user confidence in the predictions provided by the application.

3. **Exploration of Additional Metrics:** In addition to the established metrics, explore additional metrics to measure the application's success. Additional metrics could include User Retention, Conversion Rate from Recommendations to Purchases, or NPS (Net Promoter Score) to measure user satisfaction. These additional metrics can provide deeper insights into how the application impacts users and the business.
