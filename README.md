## Problem Background
Investing in gold has become one of the popular and considered safe investment options in recent years. However, the decision to buy gold is often based on its volatile prices, and investors often struggle to determine when and where they should buy gold. Fluctuating gold prices can leave consumers confused and unsure about when to make gold purchases, potentially resulting in missed profit opportunities or suboptimal purchases.
## Objectives
1. **Gold Price Prediction:** The primary goal of our application is to utilize machine learning to predict the lowest gold prices for the next 3 months. This will provide valuable information to gold investors and buyers, enabling them to make smarter and timely decisions on when to purchase gold.

2. **Gold Store Recommendations:** In addition to predicting gold prices, our application will recommend three e-commerce stores selling gold at prices close to the predicted values. This will assist our users in finding the best gold sellers with competitive prices.

3. **Time and Money Savings:** With accurate information and gold store recommendations, our application aims to help users save time and money while providing them with confidence in their gold purchase decisions.

4. **Gold Investment Education:** Furthermore, we also aim to provide additional education to users about gold investment, allowing them to better understand the world of gold investment and how to leverage it effectively.

With this application, we hope to provide a comprehensive solution for those interested in investing in or buying gold by delivering reliable price predictions and recommendations for the best stores.
